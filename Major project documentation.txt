MAJOR PROJECT SUBMISSION DOCUMENTATION 


Objective:
Building a Water level IoT system that gives feeds of the current water level in the tank to the application on a smartphone.


Boards and Sensors:
1. Arduino Uno
2. HC-05 Bluetooth module
3. Ultrasonic sensor

Theory: 
        HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor uses SONAR to determine the distance of an object just like the bats do. It offers excellent non-contact range detection with high accuracy and stable readings in an easy-to-use package from 2 cm to 400 cm or 1” to 13 feet. 
So, in theory, we can use this to stop the valve before filling up the tank to a certain level.
          
Process:
        The ultrasonic sensor sends the delay between the sent and the received wave, and Arduino calculates the distance and sends it to the phone via Bluetooth with a delay of 1 sec. The data sent is displayed on the phone and a graph of time vs. the distance between sensor and water.
